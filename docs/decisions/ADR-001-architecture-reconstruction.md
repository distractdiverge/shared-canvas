# ADR-001: Architecture Documentation Reconstruction

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-10-03  
**Author**: Cascade AI (Code Analysis)  
**Deciders**: Development Team

## Context

The Shared Canvas codebase was implemented without comprehensive architecture documentation. As the project scales and new team members join, the lack of documentation creates several challenges:

1. **Onboarding Friction**: New developers must read the entire codebase to understand system design
2. **Knowledge Silos**: Architecture decisions exist only in the original developer's mind
3. **Inconsistent Changes**: Without documented patterns, new code diverges from existing patterns
4. **Debugging Complexity**: Tracing data flow and understanding dependencies is time-consuming
5. **Risk Management**: No visibility into architectural debt or scalability concerns

## Decision

We will **reverse-engineer comprehensive architecture documentation from the existing codebase**, including:

1. **Requirements Documentation**:
   - User stories extracted from implemented features
   - Business rules derived from code logic
   - API contracts documented from route handlers
   - Data model specifications from database schema

2. **Architecture Documentation**:
   - System context and container diagrams (C4 model)
   - Component architecture breakdowns
   - Sequence diagrams for key workflows
   - Technology stack inventory
   - Security and performance analysis

3. **Decision Records**:
   - Document inferred architectural decisions
   - Capture trade-offs and alternatives
   - Explain "why" behind implementation choices

4. **Developer Onboarding Guide**:
   - Setup instructions
   - Development workflow
   - Testing strategy
   - Contribution guidelines

## Methodology

### Code Analysis Approach

1. **Static Analysis**:
   - Read all source files systematically
   - Map directory structure to functional boundaries
   - Extract type definitions and interfaces
   - Document database schema from migrations

2. **Dynamic Behavior Inference**:
   - Trace data flow through components
   - Identify integration points with external services
   - Map event-driven patterns (realtime subscriptions)
   - Document API request/response cycles

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - Identify architectural patterns (optimistic UI, event sourcing, etc.)
   - Document design patterns (hooks, composition, etc.)
   - Recognize anti-patterns and technical debt

4. **Gap Analysis**:
   - Compare implemented features to best practices
   - Identify missing functionality (tests, monitoring, etc.)
   - Document scalability concerns

### Documentation Structure

Following industry standards:
- **C4 Model** for architecture diagrams (Context, Container, Component, Code)
- **User Story format** for requirements (As a... I want... So that...)
- **OpenAPI style** for API documentation
- **Entity-Relationship** model for data documentation

---

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Faster Onboarding**: New developers can read documentation before diving into code
2. **Shared Understanding**: Team alignment on system design and constraints
3. **Informed Decisions**: Architecture documentation informs future refactoring priorities
4. **Quality Improvements**: Documenting gaps highlights areas needing attention
5. **Knowledge Preservation**: Captures implementation knowledge before it's lost
6. **Stakeholder Communication**: Non-technical stakeholders can understand system capabilities

### Negative

1. **Maintenance Burden**: Documentation must be kept in sync with code changes
2. **Initial Time Investment**: Significant upfront effort to create comprehensive docs
3. **Potential Inaccuracy**: Reverse-engineered docs may miss original intent
4. **Documentation Drift**: Risk of docs becoming outdated if not actively maintained

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Docs become outdated | High | Add "last updated" dates; CI check for doc updates on major changes |
| Team ignores documentation | Medium | Make docs part of PR review checklist; link from README |
| Over-documentation | Low | Focus on "why" over "what"; keep implementation details in code comments |
| Misinterpretation of intent | Medium | Mark inferences clearly; validate with original developers if available |

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Code Comments Only
**Rejected because**:
- Comments don't provide high-level system view
- Scattered throughout codebase, hard to navigate
- No architectural diagrams or decision rationale
- Doesn't help with onboarding or system understanding

### Alternative 2: Wiki/Confluence Documentation
**Rejected because**:
- Separate from codebase, prone to becoming outdated
- No version control linkage to code changes
- Less discoverable for developers working in IDE
- Requires additional tool access/permissions

### Alternative 3: Auto-generated Documentation Only
**Rejected because**:
- TypeDoc/JSDoc only documents API surface, not architecture
- Misses business logic, workflows, and design decisions
- No explanation of "why" behind implementations
- Doesn't capture patterns or best practices

### Alternative 4: Living Documentation (Tests as Docs)
**Partially accepted**:
- Tests should document behavior (BDD style)
- But tests alone don't explain architecture
- Combined approach: tests for behavior, docs for architecture

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Documentation (Completed)
- ✅ Requirements documentation (user stories, business rules, API contracts, data model)
- ✅ Architecture overview with diagrams
- ✅ This ADR documenting the decision

### Phase 2: Diagrams & Visual Aids (Next)
- [ ] Create Mermaid source files for all diagrams
- [ ] Add component interaction diagrams
- [ ] Create deployment architecture diagram
- [ ] Add data flow diagrams

### Phase 3: Developer Experience (Upcoming)
- [ ] Developer onboarding guide
- [ ] Troubleshooting runbook
- [ ] Testing guide with examples
- [ ] Contribution guidelines

### Phase 4: Maintenance Process (Ongoing)
- [ ] Add documentation review to PR template
- [ ] Create documentation update checklist
- [ ] Schedule quarterly doc review
- [ ] Automate doc freshness checks

## Success Criteria

Documentation is successful if:

1. **New Developer Onboarding**: Junior developer can set up environment and understand system in < 1 day
2. **Architectural Questions**: 80% of "how does X work?" questions answered by docs
3. **Consistency**: New PRs follow documented patterns 90% of the time
4. **Maintenance**: Docs updated within 1 week of major architectural changes
5. **Stakeholder Value**: Product team can reference docs for feature planning

## Notes

- This documentation represents the system as of commit [CURRENT_COMMIT_HASH]
- Some design decisions were inferred from implementation patterns
- Original intent may differ from inferred reasoning
- Documentation should be validated with original development team
- This is a living document - update as architecture evolves
